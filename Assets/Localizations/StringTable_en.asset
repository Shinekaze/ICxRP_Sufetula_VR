    m_Localized: "Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, justice, law, and victory,
      was born to Jupiter and his early wife, the titaness Methis. \nJupiter feared
      a prophesy that one of his children would overthrow him. He therefore swallowed
      his pregnant wife whole. Metis survived, living in Jupiter's head as the source
      of his wisdom, but left him with terrible headaches as she forged armor for
      Minerva. When Vulcan used his hammer to split Jupiter's head open, Minerva
      emerged, fully grown and clad in armor from the wound on Jupiter's head. \nMinerva
      was the patron of arts, trade and strategy, though she was also associated
      with music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and crafts. She is
      commonly represented by owls, snakes, and olive trees and depicted as a tall,
      athletic woman, carrying a spear and a shield decorated with the head of Medusa,
      a former priestess of Minerva who was turned into a repulsive monster for foresaking
      her holy vow of chastity. \nMinerva is represented in Greek mythology as Athena."
