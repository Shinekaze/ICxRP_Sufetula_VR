      economic collapse, civil wars, and barbarian invasions. Diocletian first made
      the decision to split the rule of the Roman Empire into an eastern and western
      empire in 286 CE. Diocletian ruled in the eastern empire and named a fellow
      military officer, Maximian, as co-emperor in the west. Diocletian added two

      of the religion. It may be for that reason that the inscription on this arch
      is damaged, chipped and smashed by the hammers of Christians seeking revenge

      was the major artery of the city. Five meters wide, it probably existed before
      the forum was built, explaining why the forum interrupts the roadway. A sewer
      system exists below the streets of Sufetula.

    m_Localized: "Sometime in the 4th century, the forum\u2019s symmetry was broken
      by the expansion of this range. A new hallway and the curia or imperial cult
      temple were added to the site. While it is clear that many doorways were added
      to give access to the hallway from the street outside, there is debate on how
      this linked to the internal parts of the forum. Here, the rear walls of some
      of the existing small rooms have been removed, which would have allowed easy
      access between the forum and the plaza and fountain outside the forum. This
      fountain was built around the same time as the expansion to the forum, indicating
      the functions may have been linked. "
