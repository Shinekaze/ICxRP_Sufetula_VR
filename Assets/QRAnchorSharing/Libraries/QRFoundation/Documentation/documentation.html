        <h1>Example Setup</h1>
        <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
        <p>
            <em>QR Foundation</em> is built to work together with <em>AR Foundation</em>. Therefore, before you can get
            started, you will need to integrate <em>AR Foundation</em> into your project. 
            As <em>AR Foundation</em> is a new and constantly evolving technology, this process will vary based on the version
            you are using. Try to follow the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.0/manual/index.html">official guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're done, you should end up with a scene like this:
        </p>
        <img src="assets/scene.png">
        <p>
            The <tt>AR Session</tt> and <tt>AR Session Origin</tt> can be created pre-configured from the 
            <tt>GameObject > XR</tt> menu. Make sure this basic setup works before you proceed. To confirm, 
            you can place objects in the scene and look around with your phone to see if they stay at fixed locations 
            in the physical world.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic usage</h2>
        <p>
            When your basic AR setup is running, attach the <tt>QR Code Tracker</tt> script to your <tt>AR Camera</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now measure the width of your physical QR code in meters and enter it as the <tt>Code width</tt> parameter
            in the inspector. The width is the distance between the outer borders of the alignment patters, as you can see below. 
            Do this <em>as precisely as possible</em>, as small errors in the measurement may result in large errors in the tracking.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/width.png">
        <p>
            Lastly, assign a prefab to the <tt>Tracked code prefab</tt> property in order to see an effect. You can use
            the <tt>Coords</tt> prefab from the <tt>/Prefabs/Debug</tt> folder.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/basic.png">
        <p>
            That's it. You're ready to try it out.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/screenshot.png">

        <h1>How to proceed</h1>
        <p>
            Sooner or later you'll likely want to be able to track QR codes of different sizes. Check out the section on
            <a href="#sizeDetermination">size determination strategies</a> for this. If you're interested in triggering
            custom actions on code detection, refer to the <a href="#lifecycle">lifecycle events</a>. You can also see
            some of the topics discussed there in action in the sample scene located under <tt>/Samples/SampleScanner</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, if you want more control over the tracking or need to troubleshoot issues , have a
            look at the <a href="#advanced">advanced options</a>.
        </p>

        <h1 id="api">API</h1>
        <h2>Tracking configuration</h2>
        <img src="assets/api1.png">
        <h3 id="sizeDetermination">Size determination strategy</h3>
        <p>
            For locating the QR code in space, it is under the current state of AR technology on most consumer hardware
            still necessary to know the pysical size of the tracking target in advance. This asset offers three ways to
            specify the size, which will be explained in the following.
        </p>
        <h4>Fixed size</h4>
        <p>
            In the most simple case, all codes have the same phyical size. In this case, this strategy can be used.
        </p>

        <h4>Content mapping</h4>
        <p>
            A size is assigned to the code by matching its content against a search string. An arbitrary number of
            search strings can be mapped to a size each.
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm looks tests the strings in the specified order to see if one is contained within the QR code's
            content. If so, it stops. You can add an entry with an empty search string at the last position as a
            fallback that will always match.
        </p>
        </p>

        <h4>Custom function</h4>
        <p>
            This mode enables you to write custom logic for determining the code width. Simply assign your own function
            to the public \"getWidthDelegate\" property of this component. It will receive the QR code's content as a
            string and has to return the width in meters.
        </p>
        <code>
    GetComponent&lt;QRCodeTracker&gt;().getWidthDelegate =
        (content) =>
        {
            if (content.Length < 20)
                return 0.05f;
            return 0.2f;
        };
    </code>

        <h3>Inversion attempt</h3>
        <p>
            Specifies whether the system should look for light-on-dark QR codes. Disable it if you are not planning to
            support light-on-dark codes, at is has a negative performance impact.
        </p>

        <h3 id="prefab">Tracked code prefab</h3>
        <p>
            A prefab which will be spawned where the QR code is detected and kept synchronized over time. Defaults to
            an empty <tt>GameObject</tt>. The spawned <tt>GameObject</tt> will also share the <em>rotation</em> and
            <em>scale</em> of the code, in the sense that a rectangle with an edge length of <tt>1 meter</tt> with its
            origin at the center will overlay the code perfectly.
        </p>

        <h2 id="lifecycle">Lifecycle events</h2>
        <p>
            The tracking has three states. In <em>SEARCHING</em> state no QR code is detected and scanning is done in
            larger intervals.
            When a code is detected, the system switches to <em>STABILIZING</em> state where scanning is done as often
            as possbile to quickly fixate the code in space.
            As soon as the desired precision is reached, the system switches to <em>REGISTERED</em> state, which is when
            the <tt>GameObject</tt> is spawned.
            The other possible transitions can be seen below.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/trackingstates.png">

        <p>
            Within this state machine, you can specify the following lifecycle hooks:
        </p>

        <h3>On Code Detected</h3>
        <p>
            This event fires right after a (new) code as first been recognized. It emits the string content of the QR
            code.
            As a little time may pass between the initial recognition and the tracking being stable, this event can be
            used to preload data or already give a first success indication in the UI.
        </p>

        <h3>On Code Registered</h3>
        <p>
            This event fires when the code is stabilized for tracking. It emits the string content of the QR code and
            the <tt>GameObject</tt> (see <a href="#prefab">Tracked code prefab</a>) which is spawned in its place.
            Based on the string content, you can for example attach different prefabs to the spawned <tt>GameObject</tt>.
        </p>

        <h3>On Code Lost</h3>
        <p>
            Called when the previously registered code has not been successfully scanned for a <a href="#timeout">certain
            amount of time</a>
        </p>

        <h2 id="advanced">Advanced settings</h2>
        <img src="assets/api3.png">

        <h3 id="timeout">Code lost timeout</h3>
        <p>
            The amount of seconds that need to pass without a successful recognition of the code before treating it as
            lost and switching back to <a href="#lifecycle">SEARCHING</a> mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some scenarios it may be useful to just set this to a very high number in order to practically never lose
            the code.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stability">Required stability</h3>
        <p>
            This can be interpreted as the maximum allowed degree of fluctuation in the tracking before the system
            switches to the <a href="#lifecycle">REGISTERED</a> state (lower value = less fluctuation = more stable).
        </p>
        <p>
            Higher values result in earlier, but initially less stable alignment. Values between <tt>1</tt> and
            <tt>2</tt> have proven to be reasonably choices here.
        </p>
        <h3>Max. scan resolution</h3>
        <p>
            For performance reasons, the camera image is downscaled before analyzing it. This value determines the
            maximum amount of pixels (width x height) that should be targeted for this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Higher values result in more accurate tracking at the cost of higher CPU usage/fewer scans per seconds.
            However, the benefit of increasing this value is neglectable. Decrease it if you need better performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Search scan interval</h3>
        <p>
            The number of seconds (with fractional part) that have to pass <em>at least</em> between two consecutive
            scans in <a href="#lifecycle">SEARCHING</a> mode, i.e. when no code has been recognized so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can keep this value rather high (<tt>â‰¥0.5</tt>) in order to save CPU time.
        </p>

        <h3>Stabilize scan inverval</h3>
        <p>
            The number of seconds (with fractional part) that have to pass <em>at least</em> between two consecutive
            scans in
            <a href="#lifecycle">STABILIZING</a> mode, i.e. when a (new) code has been found, but the AR alignment is
            not yet stable enough to count it as registered.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is recommended to keep this value at <tt>0</tt> for the fastest registration possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Refine scan interval</h3>
        <p>
            The number of seconds (with fractional part) that have to pass <em>at least</em> between two consecutive
            scans in <a href="#lifecycle">REGISTERED</a> mode, i.e. after the prefab is spawned.
        </p>
        <p>
            How you set this value depends on your use case. For the most accurate tracking over time, you may set it to
            <tt>0</tt>. If accuracy is not too important in your scenario, you can choose high values and rely on AR
            Foundation to preserve the alignment.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Stabilize timeout
        </h3>
        <p>
            When this amount of seconds has passed in STABILIZING mode, the code is registered based on the current samples regardless of the precision.
        </p>

        <h3>Debug mode</h3>
        <img src="assets/debug.png">
        <p>
            Activating the debug mode will have the following effects:
        </p>
        <h4>Debug outputs</h4>
        <p>
            In the top left corner of the sceen, you will see the following debug outputs:
            <ul>
                <li><b>QR content:</b> String content of the last detected QR code</li>
                <li><b>Tracking state:</b> The current state in the <a href="#lifecycle">lifecycle</a>. </li>
                <li><b>Precision:</b> The current tracking precision as it is used for configuration <a href="#stability">here</a>. Lower is better.</li>
                <li><b>Samples:</b> The current number of registered samples from which the alignment is averaged.</li>
                <li><b>Scan time:</b> The number of seconds the last scan took.</li>
                <li><b>Calc time:</b> The number of seconds the last processing of the scanned data took.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Simulated QR codes</h4>
        <p>
            It is possible to track virtual QR codes in debug mode. If you create an object (e.g. a plane) with a QR
            code as the texture and place it on <strong>Layer 8</strong>, it will be treated as if it were part of the real world.
        </p>

        <h4>Center markers</h4>
        <p>
            Red spheres will spawn at the estimated center of the QR code. Use can use them to diagnose your device's
            world tracking stability if you experience bad performance of QR Foundation.
            If the spheres are very scattered but remain stationary, the error probably lies within QR Foundation.
            If the spheres are moving around relative to the real world, your device's world tracking is unstable and
            thus QR Foundation's performance will suffer as well.
